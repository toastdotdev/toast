# toast

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- d9757b8: The toast.js file is not required for a site to build. the site could have just a src/pages or whatnot, so we allow toast.js to not exist while retaining any errors generated by sourceData in a way that sourceData errors will prevent a build, but a missing toast.js will not.
